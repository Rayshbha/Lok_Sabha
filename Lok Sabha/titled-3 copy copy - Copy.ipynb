In June 2013, government has carried out restructuring of \\r\\nCSS by re\\xadorganizing the schemes into 66 umbrella schemes. Details of the aforesaid \\r\\nrestructuring of CSS is at Annex-T. While review of CSS for improving their efficiency is a \\r\\ncontinuous process, at present, there is no such proposal to further reduce its number from \\r\\nits current number of 66.\\r\\n\\n\\ne) The aforesaid restructuring entails providing greater flexibility to the State Governments \\r\\nin implementing the schemes and routing of the central assistance in a scheme through the \\r\\nState Consolidated Funds.

The scheme aims at holistic \\r\\ndevelopment of children below 6 years of age and pregnant women & lactating mothers by \\r\\nproviding a package of six services comprising (i) Supplementary nutrition (ii) Pre-school \\r\\nnon-formal education (iii) Nutrition and health Education (iv) Immunization (v) Health check-\\r\\nup and (vi) Referral services through Anganwadi Centres at grassroots level. Three of the six \\r\\nservices viz. immunization, health check-up and referral services are related to health and \\r\\nare provided by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare through NRHM and Public Health \\r\\nInfrastructure. \\r\\n\\n\\nIn order to address various programmatic, management and institutional gaps and to meet \\r\\nadministrative and operational challenges, Government approved the proposal for Strengthening \\r\\nand Restructuring of ICDS Scheme in September 2012 with an over-all budget allocation of Rs. \\r\\n1,23,580 crore  during 12th Five Year Plan.  Restructured and Strengthened ICDS has been \\r\\nrolled out during the year 2012-13 to 2014-15 in a phased manner.  \\r\\n\\n\\nThe goal of ICDS Mission is to attain three main outcomes namely; (i) Prevent and reduce young \\r\\nchild under-nutrition (% underweight children 0-3 years) by 10 percentage point; (ii) Enhance \\r\\nearly development and learning outcomes in all children 0-6 years of age; and (iii) Improve \\r\\ncare and nutrition of girls and women and reduce anemia prevalence in young children, girls \\r\\nand women by one fifth.  Annual Health Survey (AHS) and District Level Household Survey (DLHS) \\r\\nwill be used as baseline for measuring the outcomes of ICDS Mission.  \\r\\n\\n\\n(d): To reduce malnutrition among children and women in the country,  various other schemes/\\r\\nprogrammes i.e. National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), Mid-Day Meal Scheme(MDM), Rajiv Gandhi \\r\\nSchemes for Empowerment of Adolescent Girls (RGSEAG) namely SABLA,  Indira Gandhi Matritva \\r\\nSahyog Yojna (IGMSY) are being implemented as direct targeted interventions, besides, indirect \\r\\nMulti-sectoral interventions include Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), National \\r\\nHorticulture Mission, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), \\r\\nNirmal Bharat Abhiyan, National Rural Drinking Water Programme etc. \\r\\n',\n",

Sabla aims at all-round development of adolescent girls of \\r\\n11-18 years by making them ‘self-reliant’. The scheme has two major components: Nutrition and \\r\\nNon Nutrition Component. While the nutrition component aims at improving the health & nutrition \\r\\nstatus of the adolescent girls the non-nutrition component addresses the developmental needs. \\r\\nTo enhance the coverage and improve the functioning of the Sabla scheme, the performance of \\r\\nthe scheme across the country is reviewed on a quarterly basis. \\r\\n\\n\\nThe Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana (IGMSY) scheme has been introduced in October, 2010 on \\r\\npilot basis and is now operational in 53 selected districts across the country. The scheme \\r\\nenvisages providing cash directly to the beneficiaries through their Bank Accounts/Post Office \\r\\nAccounts.\\r\\n',\n",

These criteria for \\r\\nevaluation of Panchayats broadly relate to infrastructure available to Panchayats, \\r\\nbasic functions, process of decision making in Panchayats, capacity building, management \\r\\nof personnel, resources available and revenue generation, centrality of Panchayats in \\r\\nplanning, implementation and monitoring of developmental and social welfare schemes, \\r\\ninterface with Gram Sabha, accounts and social audit.   The Ministry has got conducted \\r\\nseveral studies including devolution of functions, funds and functionaries by the States \\r\\nto PRIs in the form of State of Panchayat Reports.  These study reports have been shared \\r\\nwith the States/UTs.\\r\\n\\n\\n(b)  Funds under Rajiv Gandhi Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (RGPSA) are accessed by \\r\\nthe States as per need based and context specific plans selected from various activities \\r\\npermitted under RGPSA.   RGPSA extends to all States and UTs of the country.  The funding \\r\\npattern in the scheme is 75:25 by Central and State Governments respectively except for \\r\\nNorth-East States, where it is 90:10.  The scheme provides performance linked funds from \\r\\n2014-15, wherein 20% Scheme funds will be tied to State performance on identified \\r\\ndeliverables in the State plan.  The status of proposals received from States in the \\r\\ncurrent year and the action thereon are at Annexure I & II.\\r\\n\\n\\n(c) As per the Finance Minister’s Budget speech for the year 2014-15 restructuring of the \\r\\nBackward Regions Grant fund (BRGF) Programme seeks to address intra-district inequalities \\r\\nto ensure that backward sub-district units within the States receive adequate financial \\r\\nsupport. No such proposal in case of RGPSA is under consideration at this point of time. \\r\\n\\n\\n(d) Some of the constraints felt in the effective functioning of PRIs are shortage of \\r\\nhuman resource and infrastructure at Gram Panchayat level, inadequate devolution of \\r\\nfinances, functions and functionaries, lack of institutional infrastructure for training, \\r\\nlow capacity of Gram Sabha in PESA areas, lack of requisite human and infrastructure \\r\\nresources with State Election Commissions, weak processes for decentralized planning \\r\\nand governance, and inadequate and stagnant outlays. \\r\\n\\n(e) The States / UTs are encouraged to devolve functions, funds and functionaries (3Fs) \\r\\nto Panchayats.  Under the BRGF, funds are released on the basis of need based plans made \\r\\nby the Panchayats. The Schemes of RGPSA and BRGF have provisions for providing funds to \\r\\nStates for building capacities of the elected representatives and functionaries of PRIs.  \\r\\nTo ensure utilization of budgetary allocation the MoPR regularly follows up with the \\r\\nState Governments for early submission of proposals along with the requisite documents \\r\\nfor timely release of allocations.  Review meetings and video conferences with the State/\\r\\ndistrict level officials and visits by the officials of the Ministry to the States are \\r\\nsome of the other measures for ensuring timely utilization of funds.  The State Governments \\r\\nare required to transfer the funds to the Implementing Entities (IEs) within 15 days.\\r\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Moreover, there are cases of spontaneous \\r\\nheating in a few mines due to fallen coal, coal left in goaved out area and coal heaps in \\r\\nstockyard as coal by nature itself is susceptible to spontaneous heating when stacked in \\r\\nlarge heaps. In WCL there occurred some incidences of underground mine fire / spontaneous \\r\\nheating where the affected part of the mine has been temporarily sealed-off / isolated. \\r\\nSuch sealed-off panels are reopened after no signs of heating / fire is noticed within \\r\\nthe panel. Thereafter coal is extracted from these panels. \\r\\nAt the time of nationalisation in 1971, in BCCL 17.32 Sq Km area was under fire which has \\r\\nnow reduced to 2.18 sq km. \\r\\n\\n\\n(d):  The fire was caused, prior to nationalization of coal industry due to unscientific \\r\\nmining at shallow depth by erstwhile private mine owners. These unscientific mining also \\r\\ncaused subsidence and cracks on surface. Due to this, breathing of air in coal seam used \\r\\nto take place causing spontaneous heating and subsequently mine fire spread in several \\r\\nsites in underground mines. No efforts had been made by the erstwhile private owners to \\r\\ndeal with the fire prior to Nationalization.  \\r\\n\\n\\nAfter Nationalization sustained efforts are being made by the Government and the  Coal \\r\\nCompanies. Government of India has approved a Master Plan with an outlay of Rs 9657.61 \\r\\nCr for Jharia and Raniganj Coalfields to deal with fire, subsidence and rehabilitation \\r\\nand diversion of surface infrastructure in August, 2009. Under Master Plan total 74 no. \\r\\nof fires were identified to deal with (7 in ECL and 67 fire sites spread in 41 collieries \\r\\nin BCCL under 45 fire projects).\\r\\n\\n\\nThe coal mine fire survey/ study was instituted by BCCL through National Remote Sensing \\r\\nCentre (NRSC), ISRO, Deptt. of Space, Hyderabad in Aug., 2013 for delineation of \\r\\nsurface coal fires in Jharia Coalfield. NRSC has submitted their report in April` \\r\\n2014, in which they have concluded that the present fire area in the coalfield has \\r\\nreduced from 8.9 Sq.km at the time of preparation of Master Plan to 2.18 Sq.km which \\r\\nincludes both over burden dump fire and active fire. NRSC has deduced these findings \\r\\nfrom the State of Art, Satellite based technology. This finding shows a considerable \\r\\nreduction in fire area at Jharia Coalfields\\r\\n\\n\\nFurther, following Steps are taken / being taken to prevent such fires in coal mines:\\r\\n\\n\\n1. Excavation of material on fire.\\r\\n\\n\\n2. Surface sealing and blanketing.\\r\\n\\n\\n3. Isolation by trenching and back-filling; cooling by water curtain/ infiltration ponds.\\r\\n\\n\\n4.

Haque was constituted by the Government \\r\\nto suggest appropriate measures on ownership, price fixation, value addition and marketing \\r\\nof Minor Forest Produce (MFP) The major recommendations made by the Committee with respect \\r\\nto development of competitive market for MFP and capacity building of MFP gatherers are:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n# There should be strategic government intervention in the short and medium term in the \\r\\nform of minimum support price (MSP) for at least 14 main MFPs.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n# The MSP should be fixed at the national level by a specially constituted Central Price \\r\\nFixation Commission, with technical support of Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development \\r\\nFederation of India Limited (TRIFED).\\r\\n\\n\\n# It will be obligatory for the State Government to ensure payment of MSP through its \\r\\nagencies whose administrative and operational costs shall be borne by the Government, \\r\\nas envisaged under first proviso to Article 275(1) of the Constitution or any other \\r\\nprovision.  \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n#  All agencies that undertake MSP operations have to be accountable to the Gram Sabha.  \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n# The Commission would develop appropriate methods for calculation of MSP for selected \\r\\nMFPs. Under no circumstances, the gatherers of MFP should be paid less than the existing \\r\\nminimum wages under the MGNREGA or minimum wages in agriculture sector, whichever is \\r\\nhigher.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n# The MSP operation in the tribal areas should be seen as an anti-poverty measure. \\r\\nLosses incurred in the process of procurement of MFPs at minimum support prices and \\r\\ntheir disposal shall be borne by the Government, as envisaged under first proviso to \\r\\nArticle 275(1) of the Constitution or any other provision.\\r\\n\\n\\n# Market information system will be needed for proper planning of the procurement, \\r\\nvalue addition and marketing of MFP by the stake-holders. Therefore, it is necessary \\r\\nto develop advanced information and communication technology based schemes.\\r\\n\\n\\n# To improve the bargaining power of the MFP gatherers, to enable them to get market-based \\r\\nbetter prices in the long run and also to ensure sustainable management of MFPs, it would \\r\\nbe necessary to organize the gatherers in self-help groups or co-operatives or producer \\r\\ncompanies. The government should support such collectives through relevant government and \\r\\nnon-government agencies.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n#  Promotion of MFP based value addition activities in a participatory manner should be \\r\\naccorded priority.\\r\\n\\n\\n# To ensure sustainable regeneration, marketing and value addition, detailed information \\r\\nabout the MFPs is needed and a systematic data base on these MFPs should be generated.\\r\\n\\n\\n# Regeneration of MFP be made an integral part of the Forest Working Plans to ensure \\r\\nmaximum participation from the community in all regeneration activities.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n(b)  The Government has launched a scheme namely, “Mechanism for Marketing of Minor \\r\\nForest Produce (MFP) through Minimum Support Price and Development of Value Chain for \\r\\nMFP” during 2013-14 as a measure of social safety for MFP gatherers.  It seeks to \\r\\nestablish a system to ensure fair monetary returns for their efforts in collection, \\r\\nprimary processing, storage, packaging, transportation, etc., and aims to address other \\r\\nissues for sustainability of process. The minimum support price for 10 identified MFP has \\r\\nbeen announced in January/February, 2014.  For the expeditious implementation of the \\r\\nScheme, Operational Guidelines have been issued and necessary fund has also been released \\r\\nto the State agencies. \\r\\n\\n\\n(c) and (d) No direct financial assistance is provided to Panchayats. However, assistance \\r\\nis provided to respective State Agencies for capacity building of Gram Sabha and Panchayati \\r\\nRaj Institutions and TRIFED to impart training to MFP gatherers for scientific collection, \\r\\nvalue addition, processing and marketing of MFP.\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

       "  'answerText': '\\r\\n\\n\\nMINISTER OF STATE (I/C) IN THE MINISTRY OF COAL, POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY \\n(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)\\r\\n\\n\\n(a): As on 30th July, 2014, out of 100 coal based power plants monitored by Central \\r\\nElectricity Authority (CEA), 46 Thermal Power Plants (TPPs) were having critical coal \\r\\nstock of less than 7 days’ requirement, out of which 23 TPPs were having super critical \\r\\ncoal stock of less than 4 days’ requirement. During the period April-June, 2014 coal \\r\\nbased generation had a growth of 14.4% over the same period of previous year. The \\r\\nstate-wise details of the power plants affected for want of coal, is at Annexure-I.\\r\\n\\n\\n(b): The requirement of coal by the TPPs and the supply made to them during the last \\r\\nthree years and the current year, plant and State-wise is at Annexure-II.  \\r\\n\\n\\n(c)&(d): Out of 46 TPPs having critical coal stock as on 30.07.2014, supply from Coal \\r\\nIndia Limited (CIL) sources has been less than the Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA) \\r\\ncommitment, only in respect of 3 TPPs, for which subsidiary coal companies have been \\r\\nadvised to increase the coal supplies.  Supply from CIL has been more than 100% of FSA \\r\\ncommitment for 5 TPPs and in line with FSA commitment for 15 TPPs.  For the remaining \\r\\n23 TPPs, supply has been less due to various factors not exclusively attributable to \\r\\nCIL i.e high level of outstanding dues resulting in supplies in line with payment \\r\\nreceived from TPP, less lifting by TPP through captive modes, less submission of \\r\\nprogram for despatch by rail and logistic constraints of Railways resulting in wagon \\r\\nsupply not in line with indents of subsidiary coal companies etc.\\r\\n\\n\\n(e): Considering the gap between coal demand and indigenous availability, Government \\r\\nof India has placed coal under Open General License to facilitate import of coal freely \\r\\nby anyone in the country on payment of applicable duties.  Over the years, Government \\r\\nhas also reduced the import duty on coal and in Union Budget for 2014-15, Government \\r\\nhas rationalized the import duty for all types of coal and coke to 2.5%. In order to \\r\\nensure adequate availability of coal to the power plants, CIL has been impressed upon \\r\\nto enhance production of domestic coal in the country and power utilities have also \\r\\nbeen advised to enhance import of coal wherever necessary to meet the shortfall. The \\r\\ntotal quantity for e-auction of coal has been reduced substantially and the balance \\r\\ndiverted to the power sector. With a view to monitor coal supplies to Power Utility \\r\\nSector, an Inter-Ministerial Sub-Group  comprising  representatives  of   Ministry  of \\r\\nPower, Ministry of  Coal and Ministry of Railways has been constituted. This Sub-Group \\r\\ntakes various operational decisions for meeting any contingent situations relating to \\r\\nPower sector including critical coal stock position. \\r\\n\\n\\nFurther, CIL has offered all Power Generating Companies drawing coal under FSAs, to \\r\\nlift the coal  on “as is where is” basis with the stipulation that they will make their \\r\\nown transport arrangements. This scheme, which was earlier implemented by the coal \\r\\ncompanies, has been extended for 2014-15 also.  All TPPs, having FSA from CIL sources \\r\\nhave been informed to lift coal under this scheme by arranging their own logistics for \\r\\nmovement from coal offered from various pithead locations. All out efforts are being \\r\\nmade by coal companies for continued supply of coal to all TPPs in the country and to \\r\\nimprove materialization. A new Inter-Ministerial Task Force has also been constituted \\r\\nto undertake a comprehensive review of existing coal sources and to consider feasibility \\r\\nfor rationalization of the sources with a view to optimizing transportation cost.\\r\\n\\n\\nCIL has also offered 1 MT of coal from cost plus mines of Western Coalfields Limited \\n(WCL) through short-term Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) as extension of  “as is where \\r\\nis basis” scheme to power stations of National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and \\r\\nAndhra Pradesh Power Generation Company (APGENCO) located in Andhra Pradesh and presently \\r\\nfacing critical coal stock issues arising out of less receipt of coal from Mahanadi \\r\\nCoalfields Limited (MCL)/ Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL).\\r\\n\\n\\nFurther, the Government has taken various steps to ensure time bound production which \\r\\ninclude efforts to expedite Environment & Forest clearances, pursuing with State \\r\\nGovernment for help in expediting land acquisition and coordinated efforts with \\r\\nRailways for movement of coal. Steps have been taken by Coal India Ltd. and its \\r\\nsubsidiaries to augment coal production which includes capacity addition from new \\r\\nprojects and use of mass production technologies.\\r\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The Union Government and State Government, both together, have specific \\r\\nroles to play in construction of rural roads under Pradhan Mantri Gram SadakYojana (PMGSY) in the \\r\\nStates. “Rural Roads” being a State subject, projects under PMGSY are executed by State / Union \\r\\nTerritory Governments through their designated agencies i.e. State Rural Roads Development Agencies \\n(SRRDAs) or Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) appointed by States with the consent of Government \\r\\nof India.  The works are executed through contracts by the SRRDAs/PSUs. To monitor and control the \\r\\nquality in construction, a three tier quality control mechanism has been put in place. In the first tier, \\r\\ncontractor, under supervision of the field supervisory unit of SRRDA, carries out in-house quality control \\r\\nof materials and workmanship in the construction of road works.  In the second tier, the SRRDA deputes \\r\\nindependent quality monitors to inspect the roads in detail and report on the quality of the works executed / \\r\\nunder execution. These two tiers are the responsibility of the States implementing the programme. The Third \\r\\ntier is envisaged as an independent monitoring mechanism at the Central level. Under this tier, the independent \\r\\nNational Quality Monitors (NQMs) are engaged by National Rural Roads Development Agency (NRRDA) for \\r\\ninspections of roads, selected at random.  These inspections result in each work being graded under three \\r\\ncategories namely, “Satisfactory” (S), “Satisfactory Requiring Improvement” (SRI) and “Unsatisfactory” (U). \\r\\nIf quality of any work is graded as “Unsatisfactory” or “SRI”, the Project Implementation Units (PIUs) are \\r\\nrequired to furnish Action Taken Reports (ATRs) in such cases. The ATRs are also monitored by NRRDA.\\r\\n\\n\\n(c) to (e):    The quality mechanism under PMGSY has been developed based on careful analysis and \\r\\nexperience gathered from various stakeholders. The detailed guidelines both for process and product \\r\\ncontrol have been prescribed under the quality control mechanism. The quality monitoring mechanism \\r\\nis such that the shortcomings noticed are analyzed from time to time and the system is modified \\r\\naccordingly.\\r\\n',\n",

Certain provisions of the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act are \\r\\nbeing objected to nuclear equipment suppliers. Specifically, these relate to \\r\\nArticle 17(b) of the Act which provides for the operator’s right of recourse on \\r\\nthe supplier where the nuclear incident has resulted as a consequence of an \\r\\nact of the supplier or his employee, which includes supply of equipment or \\r\\nmaterial with patent or latent defect or substandard services.   \\r\\n\\n(b) In order to address the concerns raised by domestic suppliers, a scheme \\r\\nbased on obtaining appropriate insurance cover from domestic insurance companies, is \\r\\ncurrently being worked out.\\r\\n\\n(c)    \\tYes, Sir. \\r\\n\\n(d)  The Nuclear Suppliers Group has made an exemption enabling India to \\r\\nbenefit from civil nuclear trade in nuclear materials and equipment.  The \\r\\nshortage of domestically available uranium has been overcome in the case of \\r\\ndomestic reactors which are under IAEA safeguards. The use of imported nuclear fuel \\r\\nhas enabled these reactors to operate at full power over long time periods. \\r\\n\\n(e) The Government is taking steps to augment the fuel supply and add nuclear \\r\\npower capacity to increase the nuclear power generation in the country. \\r\\nPresently seven reactors of total capacity 5300 MWe are under various stages \\r\\nof commissioning/construction. Further, launch of nineteen more \\r\\nreactors with a total capacity of 17400 MWe is included under the XII Plan.\\r\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The important features of the said \\r\\nguidelines include:\\r\\n\\ni.\\tExtent of eco-sensitive zone\\r\\nii.\\tNeed for declaration of Eco-Sensitive Zones around National Parks and Sanctuaries;\\r\\niii.\\tProcedure to be adopted for identification of Eco-Sensitive Zones;\\r\\n\\n\\nThe guidelines do not prescribe any activities to be prohibited. However, an indicative list \\r\\nof activities that could be considered for prohibition/regulation/permission, as provided in \\r\\nthe guidelines, is given at  Annexure-1.\\r\\n\\n\\n(b)  The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change issues notification for declaration \\r\\nof Eco-Sensitive Zones based on the proposals received from the States after due process of \\r\\nconsultation and scrutiny. The details of final notifications issued by the Ministry of \\r\\nEnvironment, Forests and Climate Change for declaration of Eco-Sensitive Zones around National \\r\\nParks and Wildlife Sanctuaries, after compliance of the process, are given at Annexure-2. \\r\\n\\n\\n(c)  The National Green Tribunal has not specifically prohibited construction activities within \\r\\nspecified radius of National Parks and Sanctuaries. However, the National Green Tribunal has \\r\\nvide their order dated 28.10.2013 in Application No. 158/2013 in Amit Kumar V/s Union of India \\r\\n& Ors., directed that “..all the building constructions made within 10 km radius of the Okhla \\r\\nBird Sanctuary or within distance of eco-sensitive zone as may be prescribed by the Notification \\r\\nissued by the MoEF shall be subject to the decision of the NBWL and till the time the clearance \\r\\nof NBWL is obtained, the authority concerned shall not issue completion certificates to the \\r\\nprojects”.\\r\\n\\n\\nThe requirement of clearance of National Board  for Wildlife for the building projects within \\r\\n10 km of the Okhla Bird Sanctuary is based on the direction of Hon’ble Supreme Court dated 4th \\r\\nDecember 2006 in Writ Petition 460/2004 for referring to NBWL all cases where Environmental \\r\\nClearance (EC) had already been granted for activities within 10 km zone. \\r\\n\\n\\nNo proposal for building construction within 10 kms of Okhla Sanctuary has been received for \\r\\nconsideration of the Standing Committee of NBWL. The Standing Committee of NBWL is in place \\r\\nfor considering such proposals. The next meeting of the Standing Committee of NBWL has been \\r\\nfixed for 12th August 2014. \\r\\n\\n\\n(d)  The basis of declaration of Eco-Sensitive Zone around National Parks and Sanctuaries, \\r\\nincluding that of Desert National Park, Rajasthan, flows from the decision of the National Board \\r\\nfor Wildlife on 17th March 2005 that “Delineation of Eco-Sensitive Zones would have to be site \\r\\nspecific and relate to regulation, rather than prohibition of specific activities. State \\r\\nGovernments will have to be consulted in this regard and concurrence obtained.

The NAPCC includes eight National \\r\\nMissions in specific areas of Solar Energy, Enhanced Energy Efficiency, Sustainable Habitat, \\r\\nWater, Sustaining the Himalayan Eco-system, Green India, Sustainable Agriculture and Strategic \\r\\nknowledge for Climate Change, envisaging specific actions to be implemented during the 12th \\r\\nplan period. However, no specific targets have been set to combat the effects of climate \\r\\nchange and contain carbon emissions in various States and UTs. \\r\\n\\n\\nIndia is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and \\r\\nKyoto Protocol. India does not have legally binding emission reduction commitments under \\r\\nKyoto Protocol. However, as a part of voluntary domestic actions for mitigation of Greenhouse \\r\\ngas, Government of India has announced reducing emission intensity of its Gross Domestic Product \\r\\nby 20-25% from 2005 level by 2020.\\r\\n\\n\\nAn Executive Committee on Climate Change has been set up in January, 2013, to assist the Prime \\r\\nMinister’s Council on Climate Change in evolving a coordinated response to issues relating to \\r\\nclimate change at the national level and to monitor the implementation of activities and \\r\\nutilization of funds under the eight National Missions and other initiatives of the NAPCC.  \\r\\n\\n\\nAll State Governments have been requested to prepare State Action Plans on Climate Change \\n(SAPCC) consistent with objectives of NAPCC highlighting State specific issues relating to \\r\\nclimate change. SAPCCs are addressing  climate change issues through adaptation and mitigation \\r\\nmeasures in sectors namely, agriculture, water, forestry and biodiversity, coastal-zone \\r\\nmanagement, health, tourism, urban, energy, transport, mining, industry, disaster management \\r\\netc. 28 States have prepared SAPCCs. \\r\\n\\n\\n(b) A thematic scheme called “Climate Change Action Programme (CCAP)” with an outlay of Rs. \\r\\n290 crores has been launched for implementation in the 12th Five Year Plan to build capacity \\r\\nat the national and state level for implementation of activities to combat climate change. \\r\\nThis scheme comprises of eight activities namely, Coordination of National Action Plan on \\r\\nClimate Change (NAPCC), State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC), Rajiv Gandhi National \\r\\nInstitute for Climate Change Studies and Actions (RGNICCSA), National Carbonaceous Aerosols \\r\\nProgramme (NCAP), Long Term Ecological Observatories (LTEO) for Climate Change Studies, \\r\\nCoordinated Studies on Climate Change for North East Region, International negotiations and \\r\\ncontributions and Capacity Building. The funds earmarked for various activities and utilization \\r\\nof funds for undertaking activities envisaged in CCAP during 12th Five Year Plan period is \\r\\ngiven in Annexure-I. Guidelines for State Governments for preparation of projects on climate \\r\\nchange under SAPCC have been prepared. \\r\\n\\n\\n(c) Each National Mission has used available and useful technologies for implementation of \\r\\nits activities. Workshops/ conferences / seminars/ training programmes have been organized \\r\\nfor creation of awareness on climate change and vulnerability. \\r\\n\\n\\n(d) Government has submitted proposals for financial assistance to Global Environment Fund \\r\\nand Adaptation Fund under Kyoto Protocol, for implementation of mitigation and adaptation \\r\\nactivities. \\r\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'answerText': '\\r\\n\\n\\nMINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT (Smt. Smriti Zubin Irani)\\r\\n\\n\\n(a) & (b):  Yes,  Madam. The percentage of Research Scholars in China is 0 .08% of the total \\r\\npopulation whereas  that for India is 0.02% of the total population. One of the reasons for \\r\\nless number of research scholar in India is due to the fact that investment on  R&D  as \\r\\npercentage of GDP is lower in India as compared  to China. In the year 2011 the investment \\r\\non R&D was 0.81% of GDP in India while that for China was 1.84%. \\r\\n\\n\\n(c):  The Government has taken various measures to encourage scientific research in the \\r\\ncountry.  These measures include successive increase in plan allocations for Scientific \\r\\nDepartments, setting up of new institutions for science education and research, creation \\r\\nof centres of excellence and facilities in emerging and frontline areas in academic and \\r\\nnational institutes, induction of new and attractive fellowships, strengthening \\r\\ninfrastructure for R&D in universities, encouraging public-private R&D partnerships, \\r\\nrecognition of R&D units and national awards for outstanding R&D for industries etc.  \\r\\nDepartment of Science & Technology also  through various schemes/programmes encourages \\r\\nstudents to undertake research by giving scholarships, awards and fellowships etc. at \\r\\nvarious levels of education through its INSPIRE Programme.  \\r\\n\\n\\nCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) is India’s largest Research and \\r\\nDevelopment organization. It has 39 laboratories  and 50 field stations/extension centres \\r\\nspread across the nation.  These centres are engaged in research in sectors as diverse as \\r\\nAerospace, Biotechnology, Chemicals, Drugs & Pharmaceuticals, Energy, Food & Food Processing, \\r\\nInformation Dissemination, Leather and Metal , Minerals & Manufacturing etc. \\r\\n\\n\\nEfforts are being made to increase institutes of National Importance in the country.  8 new \\r\\nIITs, 10 new NITs and 5 IISER have been set-up. A need has been felt to establish IITs in \\r\\nevery state, accordingly five new IITs have been announced in Budget speech- 2014.\\r\\n\\n\\nThe University Grants Commission (UGC) provides grants to Universities & Colleges declared fit \\r\\nto receive grants as per Section 12B of the UGC Act, 1956, for general development, fellowships\\r\\n/scholarships  and Research Projects which are directly or indirectly supporting Scientific \\r\\nResearch.

The Government is closely monitoring the evolving situation in Libya and Gaza, taking into account our interests in the region. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) Libya: For last three weeks, there has been intensification of militia warfare for control of the Tripoli International Airport, which has led to its closure and suspension of all foreign airlines till further notice. The clashes have spread to airport’s adjoining districts. Separately, militia in-fighting is continuing around Benghazi in the eastern part of Libya. This has given cause for concern regarding the safety and security of Indian nationals in Libya. \\r\\n\\r\\nGaza: There has been an outbreak of violence between Israel and Hamas, centred in Gaza, since 08 July 2014, following the kidnapping and killing of 3 Israeli teenagers in the West Bank, that led to the arrest of a number of Palestinians and apparent retaliatory murder of a Palestinian teenager. This activated a barrage of rocket attacks by Hamas and militant outfits launched at Israel from Gaza, in turn triggering extensive air and ground strikes by the Israeli Defence Forces. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe conflict has resulted in rising number of civilian causalities in Gaza. This is of deep concern to us. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(c) & (d) Libya: There are an estimated 6,000 Indian nationals, including 1,000 nurses, in various parts of Libya. Out of these, around 4,500 are registered with our Embassy in Tripoli. \\r\\n\\r\\nGaza: Currently there are 02 Indians (04 were evacuated on 21 July 2014). In addition to these 02, there are 03 Indian nationals married to Palestinians, who wish to remain in Gaza.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(e) Libya: Our Embassy in Tripoli has been issuing regular Advisories to the Indians, giving an update on the security situation, advising them to avoid the conflict areas and to exit Libya, with the facilitation of the Embassy. The Government is making the best efforts for ensuring the welfare of all our nationals in Libya and bringing them home safely. In a pro-active manner, it is assisting the orderly departure of Indians through all possible routes – air, land and sea. Arrangements are being made for chartering of special commercial aircraft and ships, as required. Our Embassies in Libya and the bordering countries have been reinforced with adequate additional staff for facilitating the departure formalities and making the necessary departure arrangements for our nationals. Extensive liaison work is also being undertaken with relevant government authorities in Libya, the neighbouring countries, as well as the respective Embassies in New Delhi for the smooth exit of the Indians from Libya. \\r\\n\\r\\nGaza: Our Mission in Ramallah facilitated the safe exit of 04 Indian workers from Gaza on 21 July 2014. The remaining Indian nationals are not willing to return to India. ',\n",

In addition, the \\r\\nenvironmental monitoring carried out around nuclear installations including power plants \\r\\nclearly indicates that the doses received by the general public due to the operation of \\r\\nthe  plant is insignificant as compared to that received from natural sources and also \\r\\nare well within the limits prescribed by Atomic. \\r\\n\\n\\nEnergy Regulatory Board (AERB). Several epidemiological studies conducted \\r\\nworld over including the High background Radiation Areas (HBRAs) of India and China have \\r\\nfailed to detect radiation risks at even higher levels chronic exposures, due to natural \\r\\nradiations.  Based on these results, International bodies such as the United Nations \\r\\nScientific Committee on Atomic Radiations (UNSCEAR) have opined that cancer risks on \\r\\npopulations exposed to low levels of radiations such as those due to nuclear plants will \\r\\nnot be detectable.  In the light of these, the populations including children, living near \\r\\nour NPPs are extremely unlikely to have any additional risk of diseases, such as congenital \\r\\ndisabilities and cancer, beyond that prevalent in general population. \\r\\n\\n\\n(c)&(d)  Public awareness programmes have been pursued by the Government and  concerned \\r\\nPSUs since long. Multipronged approach to address the apprehensions/concerns of the people \\r\\nis adopted, which includes organising programmes in local schools and colleges, visual and \\r\\nprint media campaigns and citizens’ visit to various facilities etc.\\r\\n\\n',\n",

Based upon those \\r\\nstandards National Board of Accreditation (NBA) does accreditation of technical institutions.\\r\\n\\n\\nAll India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has been set up to ensure proper planning \\r\\nand co-ordinated development of the technical education system throughout the country, bringing \\r\\nabout a qualitative improvement of education in relation to planned quantitative growth and the \\r\\nregulation of technical education through stipulating norms and standards of education in the \\r\\nsystem and matters connected therewith. All India Council for Technical Education(AICTE), in \\r\\nexercise of its powers conferred under sub-section(1) of Section 23 read with Section 10 of \\r\\nthe All India Council for Technical Education Act, 1987 (52 of 1987), has notified the following \\r\\nRegulations:\\r\\n\\n\\n“All India Council for Technical Education (Grant of Approvals for Technical Institutions) \\r\\nRegulations- 2012 vide notification no. 37-3/Legal/AICTE/2012 dated 27th September, 2012.”\\r\\nBased on these Regulations, the AICTE issued Approval Process Handbook 2012-13 and  2013-14 \\r\\nfor approval of technical institutions. This Approval Process Handbook is operational for \\r\\n2014-15 also. In the approval process handbook the norms for establishing technical \\r\\ninstitutions, including engineering and management institutions, have been provided along \\r\\nwith the norms for closure of institutions , extension of approval, change of site/location, \\r\\nconversion of women’s institution into  co-ed institution, increase and reduction in intake \\r\\nin existing institutions, adding integrated courses, adding dual degree courses, second \\r\\nshift programmes etc. The Approval Process Handbook 2013-14 is available on AICTE website \\r\\nwww.aicte-india.org  . \\r\\n\\n\\nNational Board of Accreditation (NBA) was established under the AICTE in September 1994 in \\r\\norder to assess the qualitative competence of educational Institutions from Diploma level to \\r\\nPost-Graduate level in Engineering and Technology, Management, Pharmacy, Architecture and \\r\\nrelated disciplines. NBA in its present form has come into existence as an autonomous body \\r\\nwith effect from 7th January 2010, with the objective of Assurance of Quality and Relevance \\r\\nof Education, especially in technical disciplines, i.e., Engineering & Technology, Management, \\r\\nArchitecture, Pharmacy, Hospitality and Mass Communication, through the mechanism of \\r\\naccreditation of programmes offered by technical institutions.  NBA essentially undertakes \\r\\nprogramme accreditation.  Details on programme accreditation are available at www.nbaind.org. \\r\\n\\n\\nIndia has became permanent member of Washington Accord recently. The Washington Accord is an \\r\\ninternational agreement among bodies responsible for accrediting engineering degree programs \\r\\nof 17 countries namely, Australia,\\xa0Canada\\xa0, Chinese Taipei, \\xa0HongKong, China\\xa0, India\\xa0, \\r\\nIreland\\xa0, Japan\\xa0, Korea\\xa0, Malaysia\\xa0, New Zealand\\xa0, Russia\\xa0, Singapore\\xa0, South Africa\\xa0, Sri \\r\\nLanka\\xa0, Turkey\\xa0, United Kingdom\\xa0 and United States of America.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\nIt recognizes the substantial equivalency of programs accredited by those bodies and recommends \\r\\nthat graduates of programs accredited by any of the signatory bodies be recognized by the other \\r\\nbodies as having met the academic requirements for entry to the practice of engineering. The \\r\\ndegrees of Tier-I Institutions (autonomous institutions) will be treated as substantially \\r\\nequivalent with the degrees of signatory countries. The accord also recognizes maintenance of \\r\\nquality standards, gives the opportunity for collaborations with other accredited programs of \\r\\nthe universities globally. Graduate attributes identified by National Board of Accreditation \\n(NBA) which have been accepted by the Washington Accord provide an excellent reference against \\r\\nwhich the programs can be compared and a road map for every institution to improve its quality \\r\\nthereby benefiting Indian Engineering Graduates to acquire quality education nationally and \\r\\nglobally.\\r\\n\\n\\n(c) & (d):  No such study has been done to establish scarcity of technical experts in the \\r\\ncountry.  However, Technical Education at all levels in the country is witnessing a consistent \\r\\ngrowth pattern marked by setting up of new institutions and improvement in existing ones in \\r\\ntune with the quality assurance norms.  Government of India has taken special steps to promote \\r\\ntechnical education in the country.  Some of the steps are - \\r\\n\\n\\n1. 8 new IITs have been established in the country during XI Five Year Plan.  A need has been \\r\\nfelt to have IITs in every state. Consequently, Government of India has decided to set-up 5 \\r\\nnew IITs in the states of Jammu, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala.   \\r\\n\\n\\n2. All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), which is the regulator of technical \\r\\neducation in the country has taken following initiatives to encourage growth in technical \\r\\nmanpower and technical experts – \\r\\n\\n\\n(i) New Institutes can now start with enhanced intake capacity for more economical viability.\\r\\n\\n\\n(ii) Part time programs for working professionals with rules for academic and administration well defined.\\r\\n\\n\\n(iii) Promotional schemes on creation of research facilities for PG education.\\r\\n\\n\\n(iv) Prominence to E-Subscription at library and Digital Library facilities.\\r\\n\\n\\n(v) PG courses in 2nd shift to help take up PG education with jobs.\\r\\n\\n\\n(vi) Approval for 2nd shift to increase utilization of infrastructure at the Institutes.\\r\\n\\n\\n(vii) Additional division (60 seats) for lateral entry in Engineering/Technology Institutions \\r\\nto cater to large demand for degree education after diploma to provide more opportunities for \\r\\nstudents to meet increasing demand for technically skilled personnel.\\r\\n\\n\\n(viii) Introduction of new QIP centres as indicated at Annexure.\\r\\n\\n\\n(ix) Model curriculum in Engineering/ Pharmacy/Hotel Mgt. & Catering Technology/ Architecture \\r\\nfor adoption by Universities.\\r\\n\\n\\n(x) With the objective of Skill Development in technical education the scheme  of National \\r\\nSkill Qualification Framework (NSQF)  has been initiated.  As on date approval has been \\r\\ngranted to 79 Skill Knowledge providers (SKPs) and 376 Technical Institutes for implementation \\r\\nof the said scheme.\\r\\n\\n',\n",

Similar action has been taken by other \\r\\nRegulatory Bodies.  A nationwide toll free 24x7 anti-ragging helpline in 12 languages \\n(English, Hindi and regional languages Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Punjabi, Marathi, \\r\\nOriya, Assamese, Guajarati, and Bengali) has been established. Publicity on anti-ragging is \\r\\nalso given through various media by the Ministry of Human Resource Development with an annual \\r\\nbudget of Rs. 5 Crores. UGC and others have made it mandatory for students/parents for online \\r\\nsubmission of undertakings on anti-ragging. Regular meetings of the Supreme Court appointed \\r\\nAnti-ragging Monitoring Committee meeting under the Chairmanship of Dr R K Raghavan, former \\r\\nCBI Director, and other Inter-Council meetings are held.  16th meeting of the Raghavan \\r\\nCommittee  was held on 12.6.14.  There is also an Anti-Ragging Cell with requisite component \\r\\nof staff in UGC for monitoring ragging cases exclusively.  The definition and scope of ragging \\r\\nhas also been expanded to include racial and ethnic incidents. The punishments and penalties \\r\\ninclude suspending/rusticating the students and taking action against the institutions which \\r\\nmay also include withdrawal of affiliation/recognition or other privileges as per Sec 12-B of \\r\\nthe UGC Act like grant, making ineligible for general/special assistance, etc.  \\r\\n\\n',\n",

NMBA supports setting up of bamboo processing units at grass root \\r\\nlevel by providing Technology Development Assistance (TDA). NMBA has successfully \\r\\ndemonstrated use of bamboo technology for employment generation among the rural masses.\\r\\n\\n\\nHowever, being in Mission mode, NMBA had limited life and its own limitations. Now \\r\\nwith the formation of North East Centre for Technology Application and Reach (NECTAR) \\r\\nas an Autonomous Society under Ministry of Science & Technology, the National Mission \\r\\non Bamboo Applications (NMBA) stands subsumed in it. The Centre is an institutional \\r\\nmodel for creating opportunities so as to generate socio-economic benefits for the \\r\\npeople of North Eastern Region (NER).\\r\\n\\n\\n(d)\\tEver since NMBA came into existence in 2004, several technologies have \\r\\nbeen developed,validated, implemented and commercialized, details of which are \\r\\nas follows:\\r\\n\\n\\n#\\tDevelopment and standardization of technology for application of natural \\r\\ncolorants on bamboo and products.\\r\\n\\n#\\tDevelopment of commercial level kilns for production of bamboo charcoal.\\r\\n\\n#\\tDesigning of process to enhance the storability of bamboo through process \\r\\nof torrification.\\r\\n\\n#\\tPreservation of bamboo through pressure treatment technology.\\r\\n\\n#\\tUtilizing  bamboo fiber for non-woven  application  such  as  absorbent  \\r\\nmaterial  for hygiene application and wound dressing.\\r\\n\\n#\\tExtraction of bamboo fiber through pulping route.\\r\\n\\n#\\tDesign and development of prototypes of primary and secondary processing \\r\\nmachinery for bamboo applications.\\r\\n\\n#\\tDevelopment of prototype and testing of bamboo dust based palletizing machines.\\r\\n\\n#\\tDevelopment of processing and packaging technologies for edible shoots and \\r\\ndeveloping technology package for community level processing.\\r\\n\\n#\\tEvaluating neutraceuticals, antimicrobial and anticarcinogenic properties of \\r\\nbamboo shoots.\\r\\n\\n#\\tTechnology, validation and commercialization for bamboo based thermoplastics.\\r\\n\\n#\\tDevelopment of macro and micropropogation techniques of bamboo species- \\r\\nGuadua angustifolia.\\r\\n\\n#\\tComposite - Development of new products and processes. The NMBA as part \\r\\nof its activities has developed and disseminated a corpus of information related \\r\\nto bamboo in user friendly formats in the form of its publications and video CDs.\\r\\nNMBA`s activity of bamboo mat board production has involved approximately around \\n8.50 lakh man days in a unit annually. NMBA has till date constructed more than 41 \\r\\nlakh sq.ft. of space using bamboo boards in various locations in India which \\r\\nadditionally provided employment to workers involved in construction activity.\\r\\nNMBA has ensured Incense stick making industry to generate employment of around \\r\\n20.5 lakh person days. With NMBA`s technology intervention, nearly 57,000 jobs \\r\\nwere created on a round the year basis. To further develop the sector, NMBA has \\r\\nnow introduced the mechanized method of rolling.\\r\\n\\nThe economic activity of Mission`s technological interventions in the sector is \\r\\nan investment of Rs.175 crore and private sector investment mobilized is more than \\r\\nRs.600 crore, in which the incremental employment generated is around 50 million \\r\\nman days.\\r\\n\\n\\n(e)\\tThe incentives extended to bamboo sector to withstand competition with \\r\\nother countries in the world could be of three types:\\r\\n\\n#\\tProviding fiscal incentives to the Indian units.\\r\\n\\n#\\tCreating critical mass by setting up production facilities in the \\r\\ntechnology, processes and products developed for the sector.\\r\\n\\n#\\tProviding updated regulator} structure to overcome restriction on \\r\\ntransit and harvest of bamboo.\\r\\n\\nNMBA/NECTAR has assisted in setting up of bamboo based industries for production of \\r\\nbamboo sticks, agarbatti, boards, furniture, processed bamboo shoots etc, at Assam, \\r\\nNagaland, Tripura, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and other states \\r\\nof the country.

       "  'answerText': '\\r\\n\\n\\nMINISTER FOR MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND MINISTRY OF EARTH SCIENCES (Independent Charge)(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)\\r\\n\\n\\n(a)  No Madam. The weather forecasting systems in the country are comparable to most of the \\r\\ncountries in the world with respect to rainfall forecasting. During the past few years, the \\r\\nEarth System Science organisation –India Meteorological Department (ESSO-IMD) has been \\r\\ncontinuously improving weather prediction services in terms of accuracy, lead time and \\r\\nassociated impact. Manifestation of such quantitative improvement may be seen with accurate \\r\\nprediction of Very Severe Cyclonic Storm ‘Phailin’ and the heavy rainfall events during \\r\\nmonsoon season 2013 and concurrently during monsoon-2014.\\r\\n\\n\\n(b)&(c) Improvement of weather forecasting services is a continuous process. As part of its \\r\\nXI five year plan, Government has initiated a comprehensive modernization programme for \\r\\nESSO-IMD covering upgradation of (i) observation systems (ii) advanced data assimilation tools \\n(iii) advanced communication and IT infrastructure (iv) high performance computing systems and \\n(v) intensive/sophisticated training of ESSO- IMD personnel to facilitate the implementation \\r\\nof advanced global/regional/ meso-scale prediction models for improving the accuracy of weather \\r\\nforecasts in all temporal and spatial scales and for quick dissemination of weather forecast \\r\\nassessments/warnings to the users. Further, several manual operations have been fully automated.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\nIn order to capture the characteristics of the severe weather in real time, 24X7 monitoring \\r\\nsystem comprising 675 Nos. of AWSs; 1209 Nos. of ARGs; 18 S and C-Band DWRs have been \\r\\ncommissioned at Chennai, Sriharikota, Machilipatnam, Visakhapatnam, Kolkata, Mumbai, Bhuj, \\r\\nHyderabad, Nagpur, Patiala, Delhi Palam, Lucknow, Patna, Mohanbari, Agartala, Delhi Lodi \\r\\nRoad, Bhopal  and Jaipur. \\r\\n\\n\\nHigh Performance Computing (HPC) systems have been used to enhance the weather forecasting \\r\\ncapacities by assimilating all available global satellite data for forecast generation. The \\r\\nglobal model that was earlier run at 50Km grid scale are now run at 22Km grid. The regional \\r\\nscale model run earlier at 27Km grid is replaced by 9Km and 3Km grid scale models. The \\r\\naccuracy of short range (up to 3-days in advance) monsoon forecasts has improved from 50-60% \\r\\nto 70-95%. The skill of district level medium range rainfall forecast (up to 5-7days in \\r\\nadvance) has improved from 60-70% to 75-85% in monsoon season and from 70-75% to 85% in \\r\\nnon-monsoon seasons. \\r\\n\\n\\nAs far as the track and landfall forecasts of the tropical cyclones are concerned, the \\r\\nperformance evaluation of the updated forecast systems for the past 5-years, have demonstrated \\r\\nenhanced forecast skill by about 18%. ESSO-IMD currently operates 5- Doppler Weather Radars \\n(DWR) at Chennai, Machilipatnam, Visakhapatnam, Kolkata, Sriharikota on the east coast along \\r\\nwith a network of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) and Automatic Rain Gauges (ARG) for \\r\\ncontinuous weather surveillance over the Bay of Bengal. \\r\\n\\n\\nESSO-IMD has operationalized its location specific nowcasting (near real- time) weather service \\r\\nfor severe weather (Thunderstorms; heavy rainfall from lows/depressions over the land) across \\r\\nthe country. This service activity currently covers 117 urban centres on experimental basis \\r\\nunder which nowcast of 3-6hour range is issued. Origin, development/movement of severe weather \\r\\nphenomena are regularly monitored through DWRs and with all other available observing systems. \\r\\n\\n\\nIntegrated Agro-meteorological Advisory Service (AAS) is rendered now on twice-weekly basis in \\r\\ncollaboration with State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), institutions of Indian Council of \\r\\nAgricultural Research (ICAR), etc. District level weather forecast for next 5-days in respect of: \\r\\n\\n# Rainfall \\r\\n# maximum temperature, minimum temperature, \\r\\n# wind speed, wind direction, \\r\\n# relative humidity and clouds \\r\\n# weekly cumulative rainfall forecast \\r\\n\\n\\nare provided. Further, crop specific advisories to help the farmers are issued and widely \\r\\ndisseminated. The AAS of ESSO-IMD has been successful in providing the crop specific advisories \\r\\nto the farmers through different print/visual/Radio/ IT based media including short message \\r\\nservice (SMS) and Interactive Voice Response Service (IVRS) facilitating for appropriate field \\r\\nlevel actions.\\r\\n\\n\\n(d) & (e) Based on scientific assessment of the need for further augmentation of observing \\r\\nsystem network expansion has been formulated. The upgradation of the observing system, high \\r\\nperformance computing, communication, forecast/warning systems, product dissemination systems \\r\\netc. are part of a continuous process by which state-of-the-art science and technology tools \\r\\ncan be made accessible to the scientists engaged in weather research and forecasting towards \\r\\nenhancing the service quality.\\r\\n\\n',\n",

JITENDRA SINGH):  \\r\\n\\n\\n(a)   During the Sixth Review Meeting of Convention on Nuclear Safety (CNS) at Vienna \\r\\nduring March 24 to April 4, 2014, India’s National Report on safety status of its \\r\\nnuclear power plant and its nuclear safety review and regulatory system was presented. \\r\\nThis included the highlights of recent safety enhancements in Indian nuclear power plants \\n(NPPs) following the Fukushima accident in Japan, and our system of safety reviews and \\r\\nlicensing of NPPs which re-assess the safety of the plant against latest safety standards \\r\\nand practices. The rigorous periodic safety review carried out for the Indian NPPs as a \\r\\npart of AERB’s licensing process, covering all the safety aspects and considering latest \\r\\ntechnical information, was seen as a noteworthy practice leading to continuous upgradation \\r\\nin safety.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n(b)&(c) Yes Sir. The safety system of nuclear power plants in India is governed and \\r\\nenforced in accordance with the requirements prescribed by Atomic Energy Regulatory \\r\\nBoard in its Safety Codes, Safety Guides and Safety Manuals. These requirements of \\r\\nAERB are in line with the Safety Standards of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \\r\\nand other international bodies such as International Commission on Radiological Protection \\n(ICRP).\\r\\n\\n\\n(d) Persons working in the mines are provided with personal protective equipment and \\r\\nuniforms. Facilities of washing uniform and bathing have been provided in each unit. \\r\\nAdequate ventilation is provided in the underground mines. Mining equipment manufactured \\r\\nby reputed international agencies with inbuilt engineering protection for the operator \\r\\nand environment have been deployed for the mining work. Engineering safety measures \\r\\nstipulated by Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS) are adhered to strictly. Licence \\r\\nfor mining as well as milling operations is issued by AERB only after confirming that the \\r\\noperations will not cause any adverse effect on the workers, the public and the environment.  \\r\\nSeparate limits are prescribed for radioactive waste discharges and periodic inspections \\r\\nare carried out to verify conformance with the prescribed safety stipulations and \\r\\nregulatory norms. \\r\\n\\n\\n(e)  In order to have a systematic and effective monitoring system for the protection \\r\\nof workers employed, public, and environment, a full-fledged and well equipped Health \\r\\nPhysics Unit-cum-Environmental Survey Laboratory (HPU/ESL) of Bhabha Atomic Research \\r\\nCentre (BARC) is in operation at each centre. Well qualified scientist and trained \\r\\nprofessionals in the field of radiological protection regularly carry out monitoring \\r\\nand maintain constant surveillance on the environmental releases. \\r\\n\\n\\n(f) The health of all the uranium mine and mill workers is monitored periodically as per \\r\\nthe provisions of the Atomic Energy (Radiation Protection) Rules, 2004 and reported to \\r\\nAERB in prescribed forms. No adverse effect on the health of the workers has been observed \\r\\nwhich can be attributed to exposure from ionizing radiation or from radioactive wastes.\\r\\n\\n\\n(g) No Sir. However, the Indian Rare Earths Limited (IREL), a Public Sector Undertaking \\r\\nunder Department of Atomic Energy, is implementing the guidelines and directives on \\r\\nhealth care and radiation protection of the people in the operating areas of IREL \\r\\nplants, as prescribed by the AERB. Further, IREL is also providing similar coverage, \\r\\nunder its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Scheme, to people residing within 10 Km \\r\\ndistance from its plants. Kollam and Alappuzha are not within this distance zone.\\r\\n\\n',\n",

Out of the 20 reactors, Rajasthan Atomic Power Station (RAPS) unit-1 \\n(100 MW) at Rawatbhata, Rajasthan is under extended shutdown for techno-economic assessment. \\r\\nNine operating reactors with a total capacity of 1840 MW use imported fuel and are operating \\r\\nat their rated capacity. The other ten reactors with a total capacity of 2840 MW use \\r\\nindigenous fuel which is not available in the required quantity to operate them at their \\r\\nrated capacity. In addition, KKNPP-1 (1000 MW) at Kudankulam, Tamilnadu was connected to \\r\\nthe grid in October, 2013, which also reached its full rated power in June 2014. \\r\\n\\n\\n(b) The safety and security of Indian nuclear power plants are comparable to those in \\r\\ndeveloped countries. As far as capacity is concerned, the unit size of Indian nuclear power \\r\\nplants has been increased in accordance with the grid capacity to evacuate power, from \\r\\n200/220 MW to 540 MW. New units of power plants under construction have capacity of \\r\\n700 MW. The unit size of reactors to be set up with foreign technical cooperation will \\r\\nbe equal to or more than 1000 MW. In the developed countries too, the unit size of new \\r\\nreactors is generally 1000 MW and more.\\r\\n\\n\\n(c ) Indian nuclear power plants are already at par with those in the developed \\r\\ncountries. \\r\\n\\n(d) Does not arise.\\r\\n\\n',\n",

With \\r\\nregard to events involving spillage / leakage of radioactivity within the plant premises, \\r\\nNPPs have systems for containment/recovery of radioactive material so that there is no \\r\\nsignificant environmental impact. AERB has issued the criteria for reporting of significant \\r\\nevents at NPPs, which include events of leakage of radioactive material within plant premises \\r\\nand to the environment.   These events are published in the Annual Reports of AERB which \\r\\nare available on website of AERB.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n(c)  The limits on disposal of radioactive waste  from Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) are \\r\\nprescribed in the Authorisation for Safe Disposal / Transfer of Radioactive Waste, issued \\r\\nunder Atomic Energy (Safe Disposal of Radioactive Wastes) Rules 1987 (GSR-125). These \\r\\nauthorisations issued under GSR-125 are valid for three years, after which these are renewed \\r\\nbased on the request from the facility. The limits on radioactive discharges from NPPs are \\r\\nalso prescribed in the Technical Specification for operation of these plants. \\r\\n\\n\\nThe liquid and gaseous wastes discharged to the environment from the operating units are only\\r\\na small fraction of the prescribed Technical Specification limits. In its annual reports, \\r\\nAERB regularly brings out the radioactive effluents discharge to the environment from the \\r\\nnuclear power plants. The annual average tritium activity release from nuclear power \\r\\nstations has been about 16% of the limit as stipulated by AERB.\\r\\n\\n\\n(d)  The radiation exposure of all the persons working in Nuclear Power Plants is monitored \\r\\nand recorded. The radiation dose consumed by the workers due to incidents of radiation leaks \\r\\nare accounted for in the annual dose of the workers. \\r\\n\\n\\nThe adherence to the AERB prescribed limits for radiation workers is ensured through \\r\\nperiodical regulatory safety review and regulatory inspections carried out by AERB. The \\r\\nincidents of workers including contract workers exceeding the prescribed dose limits, if \\r\\nany, are published in the annual report of AERB. No occupational worker exceeded the \\r\\nprescribed limit while working at NPPs during the last year.\\r\\n\\n\\nAny exposure above the prescribed dose limit is investigated by Committees formed by the \\r\\nNuclear Power Plants as well as by AERB to take further corrective steps in this regard.\\r\\n\\n\\n(e)&(f)\\tLow level liquid waste generated from nuclear power plants are discharged to \\r\\nthe environment after suitable treatment ensuring compliance with the regulatory limit. \\r\\nThe treatment system essentially comprises chemical treatment, evaporation, ion exchange \\r\\nand filtration.\\r\\n\\n',\n",

Moreover, such recognition\\r\\ninter-alia provides an international recognition to the cultural\\r\\nheritage which directly/ indirectly invites preferred attention \\r\\nin preservation/ promotion of such Intangible Cultural Heritage \\r\\nelements. World Heritage Site status provides wider recognition\\r\\nand a higher profile, broad legal status, economic, technical\\r\\nassistance and networking opportunities and International Collaboration\\r\\nin protection. It improves the management, preservation and conservation\\r\\nlevels of the site. The site is viewed more favorably and provides a\\r\\npromotional advantage and a ‘branding effect’ which encourages new\\r\\ninvestment and increases tourism and hence sustainable development. \\r\\n\\n\\n(c) to (e)\\tYes, the Mughal Gardens of Kashmir and Majuli Islands\\r\\nin Assam are included in the Tentative List of India.

It was thereafter decided that the\\r\\nrevised nomination would be prepared by Government of Assam. The State\\r\\nGovernment was accordingly requested for this purpose.

As per the\\r\\nOperational Guidelines( no.63, Decision 24COM para.VI.2.3.2) of World\\r\\nHeritage Committee to consider the proposal for inscription in World\\r\\nHeritage List, a property first need to be listed under the Tentative\\r\\nList. At present Dal lake and Jalor Fort are not included in tentative\\r\\nlist of WorldHeritage. The details of the proposals submitted by the\\r\\nGovernment to World Heritage Committee and included in tentative list\\r\\nof World Heritage are given in annexure-IV. The reason for pendency of\\r\\ndifferent monuments is that as a part of the convention, a country can\\r\\nsubmit only one nomination from cultural category and one from natural\\r\\ncategory per year.\\r\\n',\n",

First meeting of the CMC was held on 28.1.2014.\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter the Act came into force, senior Officers of the Ministry have reviewed implementation \\r\\nof the Act in Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, \\r\\nMaharashtra, NCT of Delhi, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and \\r\\nWest Bengal,  with their concerned departments.\\r\\n\\n\\n(c)  As per the ‘Houselisting and Housing Census 2011’ data, which became available in March, \\r\\n2012, there were 7,94,390 latrines in the country, from which night soil is removed by humans. \\r\\nState/Union Territory wise details of such latrines are given in the statement at Annexure-I.  \\r\\nSection 4(1)(a) of the MS Act, 2013 mandates survey of all insanitary latrines by local \\r\\nauthorities in their jurisdiction. \\r\\n\\n\\nMS Act, 2013 casts a responsibility on the Chief Executive Officers of the Municipalities and \\r\\nPanchayats to cause a survey to identify such persons, if they have reason to believe that \\r\\nsome persons are engaged or employed in manual scavenging in their jurisdiction. As per the \\r\\ninformation available on the basis of survey undertaken, so far 11,584 manual scavengers \\r\\nhave been identified in 12 States.  State wise details of such manual scavengers are given \\r\\nin the statement at Annexure-II.\\r\\n\\n\\n(d)\\tNational Commission for Safai Karamcharis has informed that no such guidelines have \\r\\nbeen issued by it.  However, a Central Sector Self Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of \\r\\nManual Scavengers is being implemented for rehabilitation of manual scavengers, through the \\r\\nNational Safai Karamcharis Finance and Development Corporation, in consonance with the \\r\\nguidelines of this Scheme.

Many instances of exploitation of tribals by the naxalites/maoists \\r\\nhave come to the notice of the government. Such atrocities primarily include sexual \\r\\nexploitation of tribal women cadres in the Maoist camps, which have been disclosed in \\r\\nstatements of several surrendered women CPI (Maoist) cadres of Odisha, Maharashtra, Bihar, \\r\\nJharkhand and other States. This has been widely reported in the media also from time to \\r\\ntime. Such instances of sexual exploitation include rape, forced marriage and molestation \\r\\nby senior male CPI (Maoist) cadres. \\r\\n\\n\\nIn Chhattisgarh, some surrendered tribal CPI (Maoist) male cadres have disclosed that they \\r\\nwere forced by the senior leadership to undergo vasectomy operations as a pre-condition for \\r\\nmarriage with women cadres. There are allegations that women cadres of CPI (Maoist), who \\r\\nbecome pregnant, are forced to undergo abortion against their will.  The surrendered women \\r\\ncadres have also disclosed that even if they are married to male cadres, they are not \\r\\nallowed to have children since the senior leadership of the CPI (Maoist) feel that it \\r\\nimpairs their fighting capability and mobility. Further, forced recruitment of children \\r\\nfrom families of poor and marginalized segments of the society, including the tribals, by \\r\\nthe Maoists has also come to notice. \\r\\n\\n\\nIn order to instil a sense of fear in their areas of dominance, the naxals also kill \\r\\ncivilians after branding them as police informers. Out of   4955 civilians killed by the \\r\\nMaoists since 2004 to 2014 (upto 15.07.2014), the overwhelming majority are tribals. The \\r\\nMaoists have in reality killed thousands of innocent Adivasis, whose cause they profess to \\r\\nespouse. This tragic reality is glossed over by the Maoist Front organizations and their \\r\\napologists in towns and cities who have launched a propaganda war against the Indian state \\r\\nand project Maoists as the champions of Adivasis. \\r\\n\\n\\n(c) & (d): The Left Wing Extremist groups, particularly the CPI(Maoist), recruit minors, \\r\\nboth boys and girls, from the tribal belt of naxal affected areas in the states of Bihar, \\r\\nChhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Odisha. In Bihar and Jharkhand, these children are \\r\\nenrolled in ‘Bal Dasta’ and in Chhattisgarh and Odisha, the children’s squad is known as \\r\\n‘Bal Sangham’.  The  idea  behind  recruiting  tribal  children  is  to wean them away from \\r\\ntheir rich traditional cultural moorings and indoctrinate them into Maoist ideology. Such \\r\\nchildren are asked to perform multifarious tasks such as acting as informers, fighting \\r\\nwith non-lethal weapons like sticks etc.  Subsequently, after attaining the age of 12 years, \\r\\nthey are branched into other children units like ‘Chaitanya Natya Manch’, ‘Sanghams’, ‘\\r\\nJan Militia’   and ‘Dalams’.  In ‘Sanghams’, ‘Jan Militia’   and ‘Dalams’, the CPI(Maoist) \\r\\nprovide training to children on weapons handling and on use of different types of Improvised \\r\\nExplosive Devices.  The children recruited to ‘Jan Militia’ and ‘Dalams’ also participate \\r\\nin armed exchanges with the security forces where they are tactically pushed to the forefront.\\r\\nThis is to derive propaganda mileage by the CPI(Maoist) in case of casualties of minors. \\r\\nIt has been reported that children recruited in ‘Dalams’ are not permitted to leave.  \\r\\nThey face severe reprisals including killing of family members, if they surrender to \\r\\nsecurity forces.  There are no precise estimates of total number of children recruited by \\r\\nthe CPI (Maoist). \\r\\n\\n\\n(e): The aforesaid problem has to be seen in the overall context of the LWE insurgency.  \\r\\nThe Central Government closely monitors the LWE situation and supplements the efforts of \\r\\nthe State Governments over a wide range of issues, both on the security and development \\r\\nfronts. These measures include deployment of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), help to \\r\\nState Governments towards capacity building of State Forces and implementation of a wide \\r\\nrange of development schemes in LWE affected States. \\r\\n\\n\\nThe State Governments initiate legal action when they receive complaints of exploitation of \\r\\ntribals, under the relevant provisions of law.   In order to prevent exploitation of tribals, \\r\\nthe Government of India also issues advisories to the State Governments from time to time. \\r\\nThe Union Government has advised the State Governments to consider facilitating vasectomy \\r\\nreversal operations of willing Maoist cadres who were forcibly sterilised. The Government \\r\\nhas also enacted the Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest  Dwellers (Recognition \\r\\nof Forest Rights) Act, 2006 to recognize and vest the forest rights and occupation in forest \\r\\nland in forest dwelling scheduled tribes and other  traditional  forest  dwellers, \\r\\n\\n\\r\\nwho have been residing in such forests for generations, but whose rights could not be recorded. \\r\\nThe Ministry of Tribal Affairs have issued comprehensive guidelines to the State/UT Governments \\r\\nfor expeditious recognition of forest rights. The Ministry of Environment and Forests has \\r\\nalso written to the Chief Ministers of all States to treat bamboo as a minor forest produce \\r\\nand respect the rights accrued to communities as per the aforesaid act.\\r\\n\\n\\nThe Bal Bandhu Scheme, specifically focusing on children in violence affected States, was \\r\\nimplemented as a pilot project in Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar and Chhattisgarh \\r\\nfrom December, 2010 to March 2013 by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights \\n(NCPCR).  The scheme, inter-alia, attempted to bring stability in the lives of children and \\r\\nto ensure that all their entitlements to protection, health, nutrition, sanitation, education \\r\\nand safety are fulfilled through Government action.\\r\\n\\n',\n",

Indian agriculture is susceptible to vagaries of nature like droughts,\\r\\nfloods, hailstorms, unseasonal rains, heat and cold waves and cyclones.  Nearly 60% of the \\r\\nnet sown area under rainfed farming is particularly risk prone due to inadequate, untimely \\r\\nand uneven distribution of rainfall which disincentivises adoption of high yielding varieties \\n(HYVs) of seeds, fertilizers and other costly inputs to maximize crop productivity.  Climate \\r\\nchange including extreme weather events further impact food security and sustainability.   \\r\\nThe impact of climate change on agriculture has been assessed by Indian Council of \\r\\nAgricultural Research (ICAR) using crop simulation models projecting reduction in crop \\r\\nyields for irrigated maize, wheat, irrigated and rainfed rice to the extent of 18, 6, 4 and 6 \\r\\npercent respectively by 2020.  The major crops identified as risk prone to climate change are \\r\\nrice and wheat in the Indo-Gangetic Plains; rice and sorghum in rainfed regions, kharif \\r\\nmaize in irrigated zones and potato in West Bengal and southern plateau region.\\r\\n\\n\\n(c):\\tThe reports prepared by ICAR are available in the public domain and are accessible to \\r\\nall stakeholders including Agriculture Insurance Company of India Ltd. and other private \\r\\ninsurance companies. \\r\\n\\n\\n(d) & (e):    Under National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS), farmers get \\r\\ncomprehensive risk coverage for standing crops against non-preventable risks, viz. natural \\r\\nfire, lightning, storm, hailstorm, cyclone, typhoon, tempest, hurricane, tornado, flood, \\r\\ninundation, landslide, drought, dry spells, pests / diseases, etc.   Small and marginal farmers\\r\\nget 10% subsidy in premium under the scheme.  Under Modified National Agricultural \\r\\nInsurance Scheme (MNAIS), an improved version of NAIS, being implemented since Rabi \\r\\n2013-14, additional risks viz. preventing sowing / planting risks and post harvest losses \\r\\narising out of cyclonic rains in coastal areas are also included.  \\r\\n\\n',\n",

Increase in crimes was due to various \\r\\nfactors and causes for which no specific issues / conditions can be specifically \\r\\nidentified to isolate the cause. \\r\\n\\n\\n(d) to (f): Ministry of Women and Child Development is the nodal Ministry and takes \\r\\nnecessary  action on enactment of various  Acts and Amendments relateing to children in \\r\\nconsultation with the Ministry of Law & Justice. The Ministry of Home Affairs has no \\r\\nspecific role in this respect. During the implementation of the Juvenile Justice (Care \\r\\nand Protection of Children) Act, 2000 several issues had arisen, such as increasing \\r\\nincidents of abuse of children in institutions, families and communities, inadequate \\r\\nfacilities, quality of care and rehabilitation measures in Homes. Delays in various \\r\\nprocesses under the Juvenile Justice Act, such as decisions by Child Welfare Committees \\n(CWC) and Juvenile Justice Boards (JJB) leading to high pendency of cases, disruption \\r\\nof adoption and delays in adoption due to faulty and incomplete processing; lack of \\r\\nclarity regarding roles, responsibilities and accountability of CWC and JJB to address \\r\\nthe heinous offences committed by children in the age group of 16 to 18 years  and \\r\\ninadequate provisions to counter offences against children such as corporal punishment, \\r\\nsale of children for adoption purposes, ragging etc. An amended Bill was thereafter \\r\\ndrafted and was sent to the Legislative Department, Ministry of Law & Justice for \\r\\nvetting. The Legislative Department suggested that since the numbers of amendments \\r\\nproposed in the existing Act were large in number, the existing Act should be repealed \\r\\ninstead of being amended.  Some stakeholders have suggested for amendments in the \\r\\nexisting Act instead of repealing it. However, the Ministry of Women and Child Development \\r\\nhas decided to repeal and reenact the existing Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of \\r\\nChildren) Act, 2000 on the advice of Legislative Department, Ministry of Law & Justice. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\nFurther, “Police” and “Public Order” being State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to \\r\\nthe Constitution of India, the State Governments are primarily responsible for prevention, \\r\\ndetection, registration and investigation of crime and for prosecuting the criminals \\r\\nthrough the machinery of their law enforcement agencies under the extant and appropriate \\r\\nlaw(s), as also for protecting the life and property of the citizens. The Union Government, \\r\\nhowever, attaches highest importance to the matter of prevention of crime and therefore, \\r\\nhas been advising the State Governments and UT Administrations from time to time, to give \\r\\nmore focused attention to improving the administration of criminal justice system and take \\r\\nsuch measures as are necessary for prevention and control of crime.\\r\\n\\n\\nThe following Advisories were made to States/UTs for prevention of cruelty to women and \\r\\nchildren and in the implementation of various social justice measures for the upliftment \\r\\nof the weaker Sections of the Society and is also available in the website of Ministry \\r\\nof Home Affairs (http://www.mha.nic.in/).\\r\\n\\n(i) Advisory on Crime against Women-Measures needed to curb issued on 04.09.2009.\\r\\n\\n(ii) Advisory on Prevention, Registration, Investigation and Prosecution of Crime issued \\r\\non 16-07-2010.\\r\\n\\n(iii) Advisory on Arrest of an accused outside the State/UT jurisdiction issued on \\r\\n16-05-2012.\\r\\n\\n(iv) Advisory on 22nd April 2013 whereby the States / UTs were requested to raise the \\r\\nwomen representation in Police to 33%.\\r\\n\\n(v) Advisory on Registration of FIR irrespective of territorial jurisdiction and Zero \\r\\nFIR was issued on 10.05.2013.\\r\\n\\n(vi) Compulsory Registration of FIR u/s 154 Cr.P.C. when the information makes out \\r\\na cognizable offence issued on 5-2-2014.\\r\\n\\n',\n",

A total of 282 \\r\\ncomplaints were received in this Department during the year 2013. TPDS is operated under the \\r\\njoint responsibility of the Central and the State/UT Governments wherein the operational \\r\\nresponsibilities for implementation of TPDS within the State/UT rest with the concerned State\\r\\n/UT Governments. Therefore, as and when complaints are received by the Government from \\r\\nindividuals and organizations as well as through press reports, these are referred to the State\\r\\n/UT Governments concerned for inquiry and appropriate action. As regards complaints relating \\r\\nto quality, besides forwarding such complaints to State/UT Governments, sometimes these are \\r\\nalso investigated through Departmental officers. \\r\\n\\n\\nIn order to maintain supplies and securing availability and distribution of essential \\r\\ncommodities, Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2001 has been notified by the \\r\\nGovernment which mandates the State and UT Governments to carry out all required action \\r\\nto ensure smooth functioning of TPDS.

Every year the State Governments submit a State Action Plan \\r\\non the basis of their assessed modernisation deficiencies under ‘Plan’ and ‘Non-Plan’ \\r\\ncomponents of the Modernisation of Police Force (MPF) Scheme.  Each State prepares its \\r\\nplan on the basis of funds allocated to it by the Ministry of Home Affairs under the \\r\\nMPF Scheme.  The State Plan comprises of Part A (Main Plan) and Part B (Supplementary \\r\\nPlan).  While funding of Main Plan is based on normal allocation of funds, Supplementary \\r\\nPlans are considered for funding in the case of availability of additional funds or \\r\\nnon-utilisation of funds by some other States.\\r\\n\\n\\nThe MPF Scheme which ended in 2011-12 has been extended for a period of 5 years i.e. \\r\\nfrom 2012-13 to 2016-17 for providing Central assistance, partly under ‘Non-Plan’ and \\r\\npartly under ‘Plan’, to State Governments.  The items required by the State Police \\r\\nunder the components mobility, weapons, equipment, training equipment, forensic \\r\\nequipment, etc. are funded under ‘Non-Plan’.  Proposals for construction/ upgradation \\r\\nof police stations / outposts, police lines, police housing, construction of forensic \\r\\nscience laboratories and training infrastructure (buildings) are funded under ‘Plan’ \\r\\nbudget of MHA. \\r\\n\\n\\nDetails of funds allocated and released to the State Governments under MPF Scheme during \\r\\nthe last three years and current year is at Annex.\\r\\n\\n\\n(d): The proposal for enhancement of budgetary allocation for MPF Scheme is considered \\r\\nat the time of finalisation of Revised Estimates subject to availability of funds.  \\r\\nDuring the current year, it is proposed to enhance the allocation from a sum of \\r\\nRs. 1,847 crore in the BE of 2013-14 to Rs. 3,000 crore in 2014-15.\\r\\n\\n\\n(e):  The Central Government is committed to strengthening the internal security of\\r\\nthe country.  A robust mechanism for intelligence sharing among the various States \\r\\nand Central agencies is in place in the country.  Intelligence inputs are shared \\r\\nregularly by various Intelligence Agencies on real time basis on Multi-Agency Centre-\\r\\nSubsidiary Multi-Agency Centre (MAC-SMAC) Network with the Law Enforcing Agencies \\r\\nincluding the State Police Forces.  So far, 374 sites have been made functional all \\r\\nover the country having connectively with the MAC headquarters.  National Memory Bank \\n(NMB), which is a Central Data Bank for Counter Terrorism related information, has been \\r\\nconnected with 374 nodes, including State Intelligence, State Police and MAC all Member \\r\\nAgencies, with effect from 7th June, 2012.  Activities of MAC include daily Nodal \\r\\nOfficer’s meeting at MAC Headquarters, monthly on Cross Border Terrorism in J&K and \\r\\nNE, fortnightly meeting on Left Wing Extremist and Focus Groups meetings etc.  Also at \\r\\npresent, Inter-state Intelligence Support Teams (ISISTs) have been formed in 25 States \\r\\nand 4 Union Territories.\\r\\n\\n\\nAll intelligence inputs received from Central Intelligence Agency have been shared with \\r\\nconcerned forces/agencies and MAC meetings/ focus groups meetings on such inputs have \\r\\nbeen held to deliberate the inputs to develop them further, undertake pursuant action by \\r\\nconcerned agencies to augment security and neutralize the threat.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nFurther, the Central Government has adopted an integrated, multi-pronged strategy \\r\\ncovering aspects such as administrative, technical and legal to protect the security \\r\\nsystem of the country.  The Government has taken various preventive and corrective \\r\\nsteps to protect the security system of the country.  In order to address the issues \\r\\nof Cyber security in a holistic manner, the Government has formulated the “National \\r\\nCyber Security Policy-2013” for public use and implementation by all relevant \\r\\nstakeholders.  The Information Technology Act, 2000 provides legal framework to \\r\\naddress the issues connected with cyber-crime, cyber-attack and security breaches \\r\\nof information technology infrastructure.  The India Computer Emergency Response \\r\\nTeam (CERT-In) issues alerts and advisories regarding latest cyber treats and counter \\r\\nmeasures on regular basis.  CERT-In has published guidelines for securing the websites, \\r\\nwhich are available on its website (www.cert-in.org.in)  CERT-In also conducts regular \\r\\ntraining programmes to make the system administrators aware about secure hosting of \\r\\nthe websites and mitigation of cyber attacks.  As per Information Technology (Amendment) \\r\\nAct, 2008, NTRO and CERT-In have been mandated for protection of Critical and non-\\r\\nCritical Information Infrastructure in Government Sector respectively.\\r\\n\\n\\n(f): There is no such proposal to allow private participation in modernization of \\r\\npolice. “Public Order” and “Police” are “State subjects” falling in Entry 1 & 2 of \\r\\nList-II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India and it is the State \\r\\nGovernments, which have to implement various police reforms measures.  The Centre \\r\\nhas been persuading the State Governments from time to time to bring in the requisite \\r\\nreforms in the Police administration to meet the expectations of the people.\\r\\n\\n',\n",

The Government of India has been assisting the State Governments to \\r\\nmodernize their Police forces through the Modernization of State Police Force Scheme.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\nIn order to deal with the menace of extremism and terrorism the Government of India have \\r\\ntaken various measures which, inter-alia, include augmenting the strength of Central Armed \\r\\nPolice Forces;  establishment of NSG hubs at Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Mumbai;  \\r\\nempowerment of DG, NSG to requisition aircraft for movement of NSG personnel in the \\r\\nevent of any emergency; tighter immigration control; effective border management through \\r\\nround the clock surveillance & patrolling on the borders; establishment of observation \\r\\nposts, border fencing, flood lighting, deployment of modern and hi-tech surveillance \\r\\nequipment; upgradation of Intelligence setup; and coastal security. The Unlawful Activities \\n(Prevention) Act, 1967 has been amended in 2008 and 2012 to strengthen the punitive \\r\\nmeasures to combat terrorism.  The National Investigation Agency has been constituted \\r\\nunder the National Investigation Agency Act, 2008 to investigate and prosecute offences \\r\\nunder the Acts specified in the Schedule. As a part of the steps to counter terrorist \\r\\nthreats, the National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID) has been created.  The Prevention of \\r\\nMoney Laundering Act has been amended in 2009 to inter alia, include certain offences \\r\\nunder the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, as predicate offence. Further, the \\r\\nGovernment continues to raise the issues of Cross-Border Terrorism in all its aspects \\r\\nincluding its financing on various multi-lateral and bilateral fora.  \\t\\r\\n\\n\\nBesides, there exists a very close and effective coordination amongst intelligence \\r\\nagencies at the Centre and the State levels to monitor the activities of terrorist \\r\\norganizations and unlawful associations.  Intelligence inputs about possible designs \\r\\nand threats are shared with the State Governments concerned on a regular basis. The \\r\\nMulti Agency Centre (MAC) has been strengthened and re-organized to enable it to function \\r\\non 24x7 basis for near real time collation and sharing of intelligence with other \\r\\nintelligence agencies and security intelligence inputs are shared with the concerned \\r\\nStates through the established mechanism, which ensures close coordination and sharing \\r\\nof intelligence and seamless flow of information between the States and the Central \\r\\nSecurity and Law Enforcement Agency.

However, the Government of India \\r\\nhas also adopted a multi-pronged approach to combat human trafficking including commercial \\r\\nand sexual exploitation by (i) setting up of Anti-Trafficking Nodal Cell in the Ministry \\r\\nof Home Affairs; (ii) launching certificate course on Anti-Human Trafficking by Indira \\r\\nGandhi National Open University (IGNOU) in partnership with the States; (iii) a \\r\\ncomprehensive scheme for strengthening law enforcement response by establishing \\r\\nintegrated Anti-Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs) and massive sensitization, awareness \\r\\nand capacity building through Training of Trainers.\\r\\n\\nMinistry of Home Affairs has recently launched a web portal on Anti Human Trafficking \\n(stophumantrafficking-mha.nic.in) as one-stop IT information repository on issues \\r\\nrelating to human Trafficking. Nodal Officers of AHTUs of all States and UTs are inter-\\r\\nconnected with each other with intranet facility, which help in tracking cases having \\r\\ninter-state ramifications. It also provides an important link to National Portal on \\r\\nmissing children, ‘Track Child’ which is operational in many States.\\r\\n\\nMHA has issued various advisories to all States/UTs. Specially, a Standard Operation \\r\\nProcedure(SOP) to handle trafficking of children for child labour issued on 12.8.2013, \\r\\nadvisory on missing children-measures needed to prevent trafficking and trace the children \\r\\nissued on 31.1.2012 and advisory on preventing and combating Human Trafficking in India \\r\\nissued on 9.9.2009.  These advisories/SOP are available on the Ministry of Home Affairs’ \\r\\nWeb Portal on Anti Human Trafficking (www.stophumantrafficking-mha.nic.in) at http://\\r\\nstophumantrafficking-mha.nic.in/forms/Sublink1.aspx?lid=92.\\r\\n\\nBesides the above administrative measures specific legislations have been enacted relating \\r\\nto trafficking in women and children , e.g. Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956,  \\r\\nProhibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, \\r\\nChild Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986, Transplantation of Human Organs \\r\\nAct, 1994, apart from specific Sections in the IPC, e.g.  Sections 372 and 373 dealing \\r\\nwith selling and buying of girls for the purposes of prostitution.\\r\\n\\n\\nCriminal Law (Amendment) Act 2013 has come into force wherein Section 370 of the Indian \\r\\nPenal Code  has been substituted with new Section  370 and 370 A of the  IPC which \\r\\nprovide for comprehensive measures to counter the menace of human trafficking including \\r\\ntrafficking of children for exploitation in any form including physical exploitation or \\r\\nany form of sexual exploitation, slavery, servitude, or the forced removal of organs.\\r\\n\\nProtection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, which has come into effect \\r\\nfrom 14th November, 2012 is a special law to protect children from sexual abuse and \\r\\nexploitation. It provides precise definitions for different forms of sexual abuse, \\r\\nincluding penetrative and non-penetrative sexual assault and sexual harassment. \\r\\n\\nMinistry of Women and Child Development is implementing “Ujjawala” – a Comprehensive \\r\\nScheme for Prevention of Trafficking and Rescue, Rehabilitation, Re-integration and \\r\\nRepatriation of Victims of Trafficking for Commercial Sexual Exploitation. It provides \\r\\nfor shelter, food, clothing, counseling, medical care, legal and other support, vocational \\r\\ntraining and income generation activities for victims. Trafficked victims are also given \\r\\nshelter in Short Stay Homes and Swadhar Homes for women in difficult circumstances.\\r\\n\\nThe integrated Child Protection Scheme(ICPS) extend emergency outreach services through \\r\\nChildline toll free number 1098, open shelters for children in need in urban and semi \\r\\nurban areas, support for family based non-institutional care through sponsorship, foster \\r\\ncare, adoption and after care and institutional care for children and juveniles. \\r\\n\\nMinistry of Women and Child Development has also formulated a protocol for Pre-rescue, \\r\\nRescue and Post-rescue operations of child victims of trafficking for the purpose of \\r\\nCommercial Sexual Exploitation. \\r\\n',\n",

This has adversely affected the financial \\r\\nhealth of the mills and resulted in accumulation of cane price arrears.

Further, in order \\r\\nto facilitate clearance of cane price arrears of previous sugar seasons and timely settlement \\r\\nof cane price of current sugar season to sugarcane farmers, the Central Government on 3.1.2014 \\r\\nhas notified a Scheme for Extending Financial assistance to Sugar Undertakings (SEFASU-2014) \\r\\nenvisaging interest free loans worth Rs.6600 crores by bank as additional working capital to \\r\\nsugar mills.

The incentive available under the Scheme shall \\r\\nbe utilized by the sugar mills for making payment to the farmers. The Government has also \\r\\ndecided 5% blending of ethanol with petrol at all India level, which can go up to 10% in a \\r\\nState. This is expected to generate revenue for sugar mills enabling them to make timely and \\r\\nbetter payment of cane price to sugarcane farmers.

Each life proposed is evaluated individually \\r\\nand risk is accepted based on sound insurance principles. Insurance cover is based on the \\r\\nprinciple of equity and providing fair risk assessment in pooling of risks thereby charging \\r\\nappropriate premium commensurate with the risk that lives bring to the pool. Any disability, \\r\\nphysical or mental is assessed based on the underlying medical condition and individuals \\r\\ncontribute and pay appropriately for the risk they bring to the pool.\\r\\n\\n\\nFurther, an application for health insurance on the lives of persons with disabilities is \\r\\nassessed on individual merits and not on the basis of any discrimination. The risk rating \\r\\nis based on fair risk assessment and sound actuarial principles. Suitable loading of \\r\\npremium/application of exclusions/rejection of proposals is required only in cases where \\r\\nthe disability is likely to have an impact on morbidity (incidence of ill health in a \\r\\npopulation).\\r\\n\\n\\nInsurance Regulatory & Development Authority (IRDA) has stated that the insurance involves a \\r\\npooling mechanism where policyholders pay a certain amount as premium and claims are paid out \\r\\nof this fund on the premise that not all those who contribute will make claims. It is necessary \\r\\nto ensure that the whole mechanism is viable and therefore an insurance policy is subject to \\r\\ncertain terms and conditions. An insurance policy is meant to cover unforeseen circumstances. \\r\\nFor instance, a known congenital disease (which could include a mental congenital disease) \\r\\nwould generally not be covered because there is no unforeseen risk here. Moreover, there \\r\\ncould be various degrees of disability and on the above principles some conditions would not \\r\\nbe insurable. Further, product designing is left to the insurers and IRDA while laying down \\r\\nthe broad prudent framework to uphold key principles, does not mandate any particular design. \\r\\nIRDA also advises and encourages the industry, through the insurance Councils, to devise \\r\\nproducts for various vulnerable groups of society, including the mentally ill. \\r\\n\\n\\nOffice of Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD) has however, received two \\r\\ncomplaints alleging discrimination against a woman with mental illness and a girl with mental \\r\\nretardation in providing health insurance by Insurance Companies. The complaint of the woman \\r\\nwith mental retardation was taken up by Office of CCPD with Insurance Regulatory Authority \\n(IRDA). While violation of any existing norms /rules was not found in this case, IRDA and \\r\\nDepartment of Financial Services have been advised by Office of CCPD to revise and re-visit \\r\\nthe policy framework of insurance from the perspective of persons with disabilities. As \\r\\nregards the complaint from the girl with mental illness, the same has been taken up by Office \\r\\nof CCPD with the concerned authorities.\\r\\n',\n",

As a result the Scheduled Caste Population \\r\\nof Chhatisgarh decreased from 15.17% to 11.6% relatively as per Census 1991 to 2001.\\r\\n\\n\\n(d):  Yes, Sir.  The percentage of SC population to total population in Chhattisgarh, as per \\r\\n2011 Census, is 12.82.\\r\\n\\n\\n(e) & (f):  The existing percentage of reservation for SCs in direct recruitment under the \\r\\nservices of Government of Chhattisgarh is 12.  Like-wise the extent of reservation for \\r\\nScheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes in the State is 32% and 6% respectively.  \\r\\nCollectively the percentage of reservation is 50%.  As per various judgements of the \\r\\nSupreme Court, total reservation for these communities cannot exceed the limit of 50%.\\r\\n\\n',\n",

TRAI had laid down the framework for \\r\\ngrievance redressal by service providers through the “Telecom Consumers Protection and \\r\\nRedressal of Grievances Regulations, 2007”. TRAI  reviewed the regulation issued in 2007\\r\\nand issued fresh regulation i.e “Telecom Consumers Complaint Redressal Regulations, 2012”\\r\\non 5th  January 2012 prescribing a revised framework for redressal of complaints of \\r\\nconsumers by service providers.  As per these regulations, the access service providers\\r\\nhave to set up complaint centre in each service area, with toll free consumer care number,\\r\\nfor making complaints and service requests.  The service providers can also setup a separate \\r\\nGeneral Information number for providing information to consumers. The Service provider has\\r\\nto ensure redressal of the complaints and service requests within  the time frame specified\\r\\nin Quality of Service regulations issued by TRAI.  \\r\\n\\n\\nIn case the customer is not satisfied with the redressal of his complaint by the complaint\\r\\ncentre he can file an appeal with the Appellate Authority of the service provider. The \\r\\nAppellate Authority has to decide on the appeal after considering the recommendations of \\r\\na two member Advisory Committee, comprising of one representative from consumer organizations\\r\\nregistered with TRAI and one from service provider. TRAI has also mandated the service\\r\\nproviders to establish a web-based complaint monitoring system.  \\r\\n\\n\\nIn accordance with the regulations the service providers have established complaint centre,\\r\\nAppellate Authority and web-based complaint monitoring system. \\r\\n\\n\\n(c)\\tIn terms of the “ Telecom Consumers Complaints Redressal Regulations, 2012” the\\r\\nservice providers are not required to submit to TRAI, the details of individual complaints \\r\\ndealt by them within the prescribed time frame.  No compiled information about the \\r\\npercentage of complaints dealt within the prescribed time frame by service providers \\r\\nproviding basic service (Wireline) and broadband services is available with TRAI. Hence, \\r\\nthe requisite data for the last three years and the current year is being collected from \\r\\nthe service providers. \\r\\n\\n\\n(d)\\tNo, Madam. TRAI does not monitor redressal of individual grievances. However, \\r\\nTRAI monitors the performance of Service Providers against the benchmarks for the various\\r\\nQuality of service (QoS) parameters laid down by TRAI which includes benchmark for Fault\\r\\nrepairs as well, through quarterly performance monitoring reports, audit and assessment\\r\\nof quality of service through independent agencies and assessment of customer perception\\r\\nof service through survey and follows up through meetings with the service provider(s) for\\r\\naddressing the deficiencies.  \\r\\n\\n\\n(e)\\tTaking action against erring officials is an internal matter of service providers.\\r\\nDoT or TRAI do not interfere in such internal matters of service providers. Further, the\\r\\nRegulation on the subject matter does not provide for action against officials of service\\r\\nproviders. But TRAI   through “The Standards of Quality of Service of Basic Telephone\\r\\nService (Wireline) and Cellular Mobile Telephone Services (second amendment) Regulation,\\r\\n2012”, dated 8th November 2012, provides for imposition of financial disincentive on Basic\\r\\nTelephone Service (Wire line) and Cellular Mobile Telephone Service operators for \\r\\nnon-compliance with the benchmark for the Network Service Quality Parameters and Customer\\r\\nService Quality Parameters. TRAI has imposed financial disincentives on the service\\r\\nproviders who were not meeting the benchmarks for the parameters (consumer centric ) \\r\\nincluding  the ones prescribed in the Quality of Service Regulations, based on the\\r\\nPerformance Monitoring Reports.\\r\\n',\n",

The countrys refining capacity has more than tripled\\r\\nover the last fifteen years from 69.99 MMT as of 1.4.1999 to 215.066 MMT as of 1.4.2014.\\r\\nThe domestic consumption of petroleum products was 158.2 MMT during 2013-14. Thus the \\r\\npresent capacity is more than the demand of petroleum products in the country. Hence,\\r\\nthe country is now a net exporter of petroleum products. The country has been exporting \\r\\nsurplus petroleum products since 2001-02.  During 2013-14(Provisional), the country \\r\\nhas exported petroleum products to the tune of Rs.368279 crore.\\r\\n',\n",

In order to develop Coal Bed Methane (CBM) resources,\\r\\nthe Government has awarded 33 blocks for exploration and exploitation of CBM. The \\r\\nprognosticated CBM resources are estimated to be of the order of 63 Trillion Cubic\\r\\nFeet (TCF). Out of the 33 blocks, 30 blocks have been offered through International \\r\\nCompetitive Bidding (ICB), 2 on nomination basis and 1 through Foreign Investment \\r\\nPromotion Board (FIPB) route.\\r\\n\\n\\nFor the exploration and development of Gas Hydrates, the National Gas Hydrate Programme\\n(NGHP) was formulated by Government in 1995. The first NGHP Expedition-01 was carried \\r\\nout in 2006, wherein coring and drilling at 21 sites in western offshore, eastern \\r\\noffshore and Andaman sea were done to know the occurrence of gas hydrates in offshore\\r\\nareas. The presence of gas hydrates has been established in Krishna-Godavari, Mahanadi\\r\\nand Andaman deep water basins along east coast of India.\\r\\n\\n\\nThe Shale gas potential in the country has been assessed based on the geo-scientific\\r\\ndata gathered for conventional oil and gas over the years in different sedimentary \\r\\nbasins by National Oil Companies and Private/Joint Venture Companies. The \\r\\npreliminary study indicates that the potential of Shale gas exists in Cambay,\\r\\nGondwana, Krishna-Godavari onland, Cauvery onland, Assam-Arakan and Indo-Gangetice \\r\\nsedimentary basins.\\r\\n\\n\\nThe Government has, on 14.10.2013, notified the policy guidelines for exploration \\r\\nand exploitation of shale gas and oil by National Oil Companies (NOCs) in their \\r\\nonland PEL (Petroleum Exploration Lease)/ PML (Petroleum Mining Lease) blocks \\r\\nawarded under the nomination regimes. As per the policy, the NOCs will undertake\\r\\na mandatory minimum work programme in a fixed time frame for shale gas and oil \\r\\nexploration and exploitation, so that there is optimum accretion and development\\r\\nof shale gas and oil resources. Under the first phase of assessment of shale gas\\r\\nand oil, exploration and exploitation, at present, 56 PEL/PML blocks (ONGC -50,\\r\\nand OIL-6) have been identified by NOCs. ONGC has drilled one well where coring\\r\\nhas been completed. In addition, ONGC has collected cores from another 7 wells.\\r\\n\\n\\n(c):\\tThe Government has awarded 33 blocks for exploration and exploitation of \\r\\nCBM under the four bidding rounds launched, so far. Out of these, 8 blocks are\\r\\nunder development phase wherein good CBM potential have been established. The\\r\\nField Development Plans (FDP) for these blocks have been approved and development\\r\\nactivities have been carried out by the contractors.\\r\\n\\n\\nThe total established reserves in these eight blocks are of the order of 9.9\\r\\nTrillion Cubic Feet (TCF).  Presently, CBM is being produced from 3 blocks \\r\\nnamely Raniganj (South), Raniganj (East) and Jharia. The current average CBM \\r\\nproduction for the year 2014-15 (April, 2014 to June, 2014) is about 0.58 MMSCMD.\\r\\nThe projected CBM production is likely to reach to the level of 4.0 MMSCMD\\r\\nby 2016-17.\\r\\n\\n\\nFurther, 10 CBM blocks have been identified for offer under the proposed Uniformed\\r\\nLicensing Policy (ULP). Out of these, 6 blocks are located in Gujarat State, 2 \\r\\nblocks in Madhya Pradesh and 2 blocks in Maharashtra State.\\r\\n\\n\\nd):\\tYes, Madam.  Four Contractors namely M/s Great Eastern Energy Corporation\\r\\nLimited (GEECL) (Raniganj South block), M/s Essar (Raniganj East block), ONGC \\n(Jharia block) and Reliance Industries Limited (Sohagpur East & West blocks) have\\r\\nsought the approval of Government of India (GoI) for the gas price formula/basis \\r\\nfor valuation of CBM gas. The approval of GoI has been issued for 3 contractors \\r\\nnamely M/s GEECL, M/s Essar and ONGC. The proposal of RIL has been scrutinized \\r\\nand additional information has been sought.\\r\\n',\n",

This policy envisages to increase revenues \\r\\nof IT and ITES Industry from USD 100 Billion at present to USD 300 Billion by 2020 \\r\\nincluding exports of USD 200 Billion. The key strategies identified in NPIT 2012 \\r\\ninclude creation of an ecosystem for a globally competitive IT/ITES Industry, which\\r\\ninter alia envisages formulation of fiscal and other policies to attract investment\\r\\nin IT industry in Tier II and Tier III cities. \\r\\n\\n\\nThe focus of the policy is on deployment of ICT in all sectors of the economy and\\r\\nproviding IT based solutions to address citizen centric issues. It also aims to \\r\\nfurther boost the contribution of our IT and IT enabled services (IT-ITeS) sector\\r\\nto the national economy. The policy seeks to achieve the twin goals of bringing the\\r\\nfull power of ICT within the reach of the entire country and harnessing the capability\\r\\nand human resources of the nation to enable India to emerge as the global hub and \\r\\ndestination for the IT and ITeS sector by 2020.  \\r\\n\\n\\n(c):\\tYes, Sir. Government of India has approved the National e-Governance Plan \\n(NeGP) as a comprehensive package for integration and development of ICT in the \\r\\ncountry on 18th May, 2006 with a common vision, implementation methodology and \\r\\nmanagement structure to implement e-Governance projects in the country. NeGP\\r\\ncomprises of 31 Mission Mode Projects (MMPs) being implemented at the central,\\r\\nstate and local Government levels and have a singular mission to make all\\r\\nGovernment services accessible to the common person in his/her locality, through\\r\\nefficient, transparent and reliable mechanisms. These consist of 11 central MMPS,\\r\\n13 state MMPs and 7 integrated MMPs. The common program support components are \\r\\naimed at creating the right governance and institutional mechanisms, core \\r\\ninfrastructure, policies & standards and the necessary legal framework for adoption\\r\\nof e-Governance in the country. A total of 222 services are being provided under\\r\\nthese MMPs with an average of over 11.76 crore e-Transactions/month.\\r\\n\\n\\nUnder the programme, robust e-infrastructure is being created to facilitate deployment \\r\\nof ICT solutions by various Departments and state Governments. Significant progress has\\r\\nbeen made in the implementation of the core infrastructure components and also in most\\r\\nof the Mission Mode Projects. 33 State Wide Area Networks (SWANs) and 23 State Data\\r\\nCentres (SDCs) are already operational. The State Service Delivery Gateways (SSDGs)\\r\\nhave been implemented in 19 States. For making public services available to citizens\\r\\non anytime, anywhere basis, Department of Electronics and Information Technology has\\r\\nestablished 135,598 Common Services Centres across the country for enabling the people\\r\\nto access e-Governance services. Under the Mobile Seva project, an integrated common\\r\\nMobile Service Delivery Gateway (MSDG) has also been created and made operational for \\r\\nenabling Government Departments to deliver mobile based services. Standards have been \\r\\nlaid down in the areas of open standards, biometric standards, metadata & data standards,\\r\\nlocalization and language technology standards, etc. E-District MMP, which aims to provide \\r\\nhigh volume services that are delivered from the district or sub-district level and are\\r\\ncurrently not covered by any MMP under the NeGP is being implemented in all districts\\r\\nacross the country. Significant progress has also been made in the delivery of services\\r\\nidentified under the various Mission Mode Projects. \\r\\n\\n\\n(d):\\tYes, Sir.  Government has planned to improve the technical efficiency of ICT \\r\\nsectors and use of Data Envelopment Analysis to analyse the relative efficiency and \\r\\nproductivity change in various sectors in the country under the projects of National\\r\\ne-Governance Plan (NeGP).\\r\\n\\n\\nUnder State Wide Area Network (SWAN) project of NeGP, it was targeted to enhance the\\r\\nutilisation of bandwidth to more than 60% of the existing link capacity of 25 States/UTs\\r\\nby connecting horizontal offices through SWAN. So far, 24 states/UTs have increased \\r\\ntheir bandwidth utilization to more than 60% of the existing link capacity. Also, to\\r\\nmonitor the performance of SWANs, the Department has mandated positioning of Third\\r\\nParty Auditors (TPAa) in the states/UTs. As on date, 27 states have empanelled the\\r\\nTPAs for monitoring the performance of the SWANs in the respective states/UTs.\\r\\nRemaining states/UTs are in the process of empanelment of TPA.\\r\\n\\n\\nUnder State Data Centre (SDC) project 17 states are utilizing more than 50% of the SDC \\r\\ninfrastructure (percentage of rack space utilized). Also, in order to utilize and harness\\r\\nthe benefits of Cloud Computing, Government of India has taken an initiative namely GI-Cloud\\n(MeghRaj). The focus of this initiative is to accelerate delivery of e-services in the \\r\\ncountry while optimizing ICT spending of the Government. This will ensure optimum utilization \\r\\nof the infrastructure and speed up the development and deployment of eGov applications.\\r\\nSome of the major benefits of MeghRaj are listed below: \\r\\n\\n\\n#\\tOptimum utilization of Infrastructure\\r\\n\\n\\n#\\tSpeeding up the IT procurement cycle for eGov applications \\r\\n\\n\\n#\\tInfrastructure elasticity – scale up and scale down based on the load\\r\\n\\n\\n#\\tEasy replication of successful applications across States to avoid duplication of \\r\\napplication development efforts \\r\\n\\n\\n#\\tAvailability of certified applications following common standards at National AppStore \\r\\nCurrent status of Meghraj project is following: \\r\\n\\n\\n#\\tTwo Cloud reports namely Strategic Direction Paper & Strategic Direction Paper \\r\\npublished in June 2013\\r\\n\\n\\n#\\tFirst National Cloud under MeghRaj, implemented by NIC has been launched in Feb, 2014.\\r\\n\\n\\n#\\tNational e-Gov AppStore was launched in May 2013 with 20 applications and 9 components.\\r\\n',\n",
